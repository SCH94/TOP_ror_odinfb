# Odin Facebook
Odin Facebook is the final project of The Odin Project's Rails curriculum. The assignment can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project). The project is live via Heroku [here](https://obscure-springs-25850.herokuapp.com/)

The primary challenge was configuring the user associations, given that, in a symmetrical, Facebook-style relationship, a user can be either a user requesting a friendship or a user receiving a friendship request.

This project was also the first opportunity I had to play around with Devise, which is a beast in and of itself.
